# ADR-010 — Require Complete Decision Lineage

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Decision owner:** Founder / Architecture  
**Initial decision date:** 2026-08-20  
**Applies to:** V0.1  
**Supersedes:** None  
**Superseded by:** None

## Context

An investment platform must be able to explain exactly why a decision occurred.

## Decision Drivers

- correctness;
- auditability;
- risk control;
- implementation speed;
- future institutional readiness;
- reversibility;
- operational simplicity.

## Options Considered

1. Store final recommendation only
2. Store model prompts only
3. Store source-to-outcome lineage

## Decision

Every material decision must be reconstructable from source through evidence, reasoning, committee, risk, execution, and outcome.

## Rationale

Auditability is a core product feature and future institutional requirement.

## Positive Consequences

- Debuggable
- Auditable
- Reproducible

## Negative Consequences / Trade-Offs

- Higher storage and engineering burden

## Risks and Controls

| Risk | Control |
|---|---|
| Decision becomes stale | Review trigger and superseding ADR |
| Implementation drifts from decision | Ticket/spec traceability and architecture tests |
| Hidden exception weakens control | Audit exception and explicit approval |
| Operational shortcut bypasses intent | Definition of Done and release review |

## Implementation Impact

This decision must be reflected in the relevant:

- charter/governance documents;
- architecture;
- specifications;
- data catalog;
- agent/tool permissions where relevant;
- operations/runbooks;
- tests;
- implementation tickets.

## Validation

Validation requires automated or review evidence demonstrating that implementation behavior matches this decision.

Where the decision is architectural, at least one negative test SHOULD prove that the prohibited alternative path is blocked.

## Reversal / Migration

If this decision changes:

1. create a new ADR;
2. mark this record superseded;
3. define migration;
4. update affected packages;
5. update tests;
6. preserve historical decisions made under this ADR.

## Review Triggers

- Audit architecture is formally replaced by a stronger model

## Final Decision State

**ACCEPTED**
